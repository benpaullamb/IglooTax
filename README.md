A simple income tax calculator web application. Takes a user's annual gross salary as input and outputs the annual net salary, showing the amount of tax paid in each band, national insurance contributions, and student loan deductions (both yearly and monthly). This covers the main task and all three extension tasks.

You can access this web app here: https://benpaullamb.github.io/IglooTax/ hosted on GitHub Pages. Please note the web app does not use mobile-first design and may not look as good on a mobile device.

This web app uses option 1. front-end application. I created this with React.js. The design of the application is made to mimic Igloo Energy's website design.

Some basics tests were written with Jest for the gross to net calculations, including actual example salaries, along with other inputs such as non-numbers.
