A simple income tax calculator web application. Takes a user's annual gross salary as input and outputs the annual net salary, showing the amount of tax paid in each band, national insurance contributions, and student loan deductions (both yearly and monthly). This covers the main task and all three extension tasks.

This web app uses option 1. front-end application. I created this with React.js. The design of the application is made to mimic Igloo Energy's website design.
